# Whisker LLM
Whisker LLM Shell.

This project is a mock Large Language Model (LLM) UI shell built for presentation and demonstration purposes. It focuses on frontend design and interaction, replicating the look and behavior of a modern AI chat application without integrating a real LLM.

The interface is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure maximum portability and easy adaptation across different languages, frameworks, or backend systems.

All AI responses are simulated, and the project is intentionally scoped as a frontend-only UI mockup.

Test Questions (Hardcoded Responses)

Use the following prompts to trigger predefined AI responses during demonstration:

How do I calibrate the DFI sensor on a LR5?

The cx is having issues with hopper disconnected on their LR5 Pro with no hopper attached.

Attach any image using the + button, then type: what is this part?
