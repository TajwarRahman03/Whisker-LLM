# Whisker LLM
Whisker LLM Shell

This project is a mock Large Language Model (LLM) user interface shell built for presentation and demonstration purposes. It focuses on frontend design and interaction, replicating the look and behavior of a modern AI chat application without integrating a real LLM.

The interface is built entirely using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure maximum portability and easy adaptation across different languages, frameworks, or backend systems.

All AI responses are simulated. The project is intentionally scoped as a frontend-only UI mockup designed to showcase layout, interaction flow, and user experience rather than backend intelligence or model integration.


Test Questions (Hardcoded Responses)

Use the following prompts to trigger predefined responses during demonstrations. These prompts do not require exact wording — partial phrasing or keyword combinations may still activate the responses.

How do I calibrate the DFI sensor on a LR5?

The cx is having issues with hopper disconnected on their LR5 Pro with no hopper attached.

What’s the SKU for the LR5 base in black?

Can you share the CX issue tracker link or sheet?

Attach any image using the + button, then type:
“what is this part?”
